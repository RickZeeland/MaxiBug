Any time interval other than seconds produces an error message, as expected. Player.Seek should not hand off the properties to another process.\r\n\r\nIf the user enters a negative minutes, hours, or milliseconds property, an error message is returned: \"Received value does not match any of the union type definitions\"\r\nActual Behavior\r\n\r\nProduces erroneous behavior inconsistent with Player.Seek expected behavior. The media player acts as if it received a Rewind command.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n{\"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"method\": \"Player.Seek\", \"params\":{\"playerid\":1,\"value\":{\"seconds\":-15}},\"id\": 1}\r\n\r\nThe result in this use case is similar to Rewind (re: Input.Action). Player.Seek appears to use the incorrect time index, to which the negative \"seconds\" value is applied. The time offset appears to be indexed (incorrectly) from the current time instead of time 0 (zero; i.e. beginning of media). The latter pattern is consistent with all other behavior from Player.Seek\r\nPossible Fix\r\n\r\nThis only occurs under one scenario. When all of the following are true:\r\n\r\n    Player ID is valid\r\n    Only the Seconds time unit is received\r\n    Unit time Value is a negative integer\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n{\"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"method\": \"Player.Seek\", \"params\":{\"playerid\":1,\"value\":{\"minutes\":15, \"seconds\": 12}},\"id\": 1}\r\n\r\nI suspect one of two scenarios is occurring. Either\r\n\r\na) Code is branching incorrectly when Player.Seek receives the specified object properties\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\nb) The logic surrounding the time index, which is normally zero (0) or the beginning of the media content (e.g. movie) is not being zero'd out, but rather the current media player time pointer is being used as an index, to which the time value in the JSON command is then applied\r\nTo Reproduce\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n\r\n    Begin playing a video file in Kodi\r\n    Wait until the timer for the video is past the first minute\r\n    Using CURL, Postman, or similar test tool, send a JSON-RPC API command to Kodi, similar to the following example. The command should include a Player ID = 1 and the Seconds parameter equal to a negative integer less than 60. Suggest using a value greater than 10 to ensure the behavior is obvious.\r\n\r\n{\"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"method\": \"Player.Seek\", \"params\":{\"playerid\":1,\"value\":{\"seconds\":-15}},\"id\": 1}\r\n\r\n    Observe that Kodi behaves as if it received a Rewind command (e.g. via Input.Action), and rewinds the timer pointing to the current time being played on the video media by the same number of seconds indicated in the JSON command.\r\n\r\nDebuglog\r\n\r\nThe debuglog can be found here:\r\nScreenshots\r\n\r\nHere are some links or screenshots to help explain the problem:\r\nAdditional context or screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\nHere is some additional context or explanation that might help:\r\n\r\nHow do I know this is a bug and not WAD? Because if I use any other time unit (i.e. milliseconds, minutes, hours), I receive an error message. Furthermore, the opposite behavior (using a positive integer) results in a different set of behavior. Namely, Player.Seek moves the media player time pointer to an offset from the beginning of the media (start) equal to the time units passed in the JSON command.\r\n\r\nFor example, if I am watching a movie that is at time point 01:02:03 and I execute this command in the API:\r\n\r\n{\"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"method\": \"Player.Seek\", \"params\":{\"playerid\":1,\"value\":{\"minutes\":15, \"seconds\": 12}},\"id\": 1}\r\n\r\nThe result is the media player moves the current pointer (point in the movie being played right now) to 15 minutes, 12 seconds from the beginning of of the movie.\r\n\r\nAnother example supporting my argument: If the same type of command as the error-producing command is implemented, except the Value integer is positive, Player.Seek treats the Value as a percentage and passes the instruction on to Player.Position.Percentage\r\n\r\n{\"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"method\": \"Player.Seek\", \"params\":{\"playerid\":1,\"value\":17},\"id\": 1}\r\n\r\nThe result is the currently playing media pointer shifts the time to 17% of the total movie length. On a 2 hour long movie, that would be 20.4 minutes into the film.","DateCreated":"2019-05-08T21:56:46.3428505+01:00","DateModified":"2019-05-08T21:56:46.3428505+01:00"},"6":{"ID":6,"Priority":3,"Status":2,"Version":"0.48.4","TargetVersion":"","Summary":"Fill/Stroke crash","Description":"If I select a tool like the 'freehand lines' or 'calligraphy' and click on the fill/stroke icon in the corner of the screen, inkscape crashes with the message 'inkscape encountered an internal error and will close now'.
